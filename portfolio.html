              <h3>Core Functionality</h3>
              <p>Each challenge is designed with a clear goal: to “hack” the system and retrieve specific data — such as
                a URL, token, or code snippet. Once obtained, this data must be entered into a dedicated input field to
                validate whether the hack was successful.</p>
              <p>
                A dynamic frontend module for a series of cybersecurity challenges where users attempt to "hack" the
                system to extract specific data (e.g., URL, token, or code snippet).
              </p>
              <h3>Key Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Input field for submitting payloads and verifying solutions</li>
                <li>Multiple timers to simulate real-time pressure (top bar, button, animated tab bar)</li>
                <li>Tab navigation for switching between challenges</li>
                <li>Leaderboard showing participant stats and top performers</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Built the full <strong>frontend</strong> using <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and
                  <code>JavaScript</code></li>
                <li>Implemented layout, styles, transitions, and interactivity</li>

              <h3>Custom Testimonials Module</h3>
              <p>This custom re-usable module was designed to display authentic user feedback gathered from various
                social media platforms.
                Each card showcases a real comment about the product, highlighting users' appreciation and experience.
              </p>
              <h3>Key Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Dynamic content: Each card contains a user’s comment, along with their name, position, platform, and
                  date</li>
                <li>Responsive grid layout: The cards are displayed in a flexible, multi-column grid that adapts to
                  different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Variable content height: Since the length of each testimonial varies, I implemented a
                  JavaScript-based layout engine that
                  dynamically stacks cards one after another without enforcing uniform height. This avoids whitespace
                  and ensures optimal use of
                  vertical space.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Tag-Based Filtering: <br> At the top of the module, category tags allow users to filter
